        Hi, I am Ram, Hope you are enjoying your day!
        <br />
        <br />
        I am Frontend Engineer with a strong Frontend skill-set, focus on
        details and passion for building interactive user experiences for the
        web. I have extensive knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming as well
        as significant experience of using modern JS Library & framework such as
        Reactjs Vuejs React native and Angular, nodejs framework such as
        Expressjs.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am proficient in PHP, JS and Java. I like to build things and tinker
        with new technologies. I believe Language or technology is just a tool
        to achieve what is required, hence I am language agnostic and I tend to
        learn new technologies very quickly.
        <br />
        <br />I enjoy a good cup of coffee{" "}
