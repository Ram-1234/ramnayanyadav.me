             I am Frontend Engineer with a strong Frontend skill-set, focus on details and passion for building interactive user experiences for the web. I have extensive knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming as well as significant experience of using modern JS frameworks such as Angular and React, and backend framework such as Expressjs.
             <br/><br/>
             I am proficient in PHP, JS and Java. I like to build things and tinker with new technologies. I believe Language or technology is just a tool to achieve what is required, hence I am language agnostic and I tend to learn new technologies very quickly.
             <br/><br/>
             I enjoy a good cup of coffee <strong style={{color:"#9e2a2b",fontSize:"30px"}}>☕</strong>, travelling <strong style={{color:"#9e2a2b",fontSize:"20px"}}>🚎</strong>, origami(art) <strong>🎨</strong> and, watching movies<strong style={{color:"#9e2a2b",fontSize:"20px"}}>🦸</strong>and TV shows.</p>
